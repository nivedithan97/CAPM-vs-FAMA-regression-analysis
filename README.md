# CAPM-vs-FAMA-regression-analysis
An Econometrics project which aims to understand which types of risks are vital in order to determine the price of an asset (or in this case, portfolio). Moreover, the regression attempts to help provide a discussion as to whether or not price can be affected by something other than risk, such as seasonal trends. Further, it attempts to discuss whether a model with more variables provides more cohesive information.
